# About Me

<!-- <img src="{{ "/assets/images/routeburn.jpg" | absolute_url }}"
width="50%" hspace="20" align="right"> -->

I am a dedicated data scientist with a deep expertise in machine learning and speech signal processing. My current work revolves around leveraging cutting-edge techniques in machine learning and deep learning to tackle challenging problems in speech synthesis and voice conversion, and transforming them into products that are both beautiful and functional.

My ultimate goal is to use my skills and knowledge to make machines smarter and more capable, while also helping to empower and elevate humanity as a whole.

Educational background:
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from the prestigious Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Following this, I pursued my Master's degree in Electrical and Engineering from Yonsei University in South Korea, where I had the privilege of conducting research under the expert guidance of Professor [Kang Hong-Goo](http://dsp.yonsei.ac.kr/member/professor/) and working as a member of the [DSP&AI lab](http://dsp.yonsei.ac.kr/).

Currently, I am proud to be working as a data scientist at [lovo.ai](https://www.lovo.ai/), where my primary focus is on developing advanced synthetic voices that can closely replicate the nuances and complexities of human speech. Through the use of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, I am passionate about helping to create products that are not only functional but also truly remarkable.

When I'm not busy pushing the boundaries of data science and speech signal processing, I enjoy staying active by hitting the gym and playing soccer. I'm also an avid podcast listener and love spending time with friends by the scenic Han River. In my spare time, I like to explore new ideas and perspectives by reading books on a wide range of topics, from productivity and mindset to personal finance and beyond.

If you're interested in connecting with me or learning more about my work, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities.
