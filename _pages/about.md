# About Me

<!-- <img src="{{ "/assets/images/routeburn.jpg" | absolute_url }}"
width="50%" hspace="20" align="right"> -->
  
I am a data scientist specializing in machine learning and speech signal processing. Currently, my work is primarily relevant to using machine learning, and deep learning to solve problems in speech synthesis and voice conversion areas and turn them into beautiful products.

My mission in life is to make machines better machines, make humans better humans.

Educational background:
* Hold a bachelor degree in Electronics and Telecomunications from Hanoi University of Science and Technology
* Finished my master in Electrical and Engineering from Yonsei University, South Korea. During my master, I was doing research under supervision of Prof. [Kang Hong-Goo](http://dsp.yonsei.ac.kr/member/professor/) and a member of [DSP&AI lab](http://dsp.yonsei.ac.kr/)

Currently, I am working as a data scientist for [lovo.ai](https://www.lovo.ai/) where I am lazer-focusing on human-like synthetic voices for text-to-speech and voice conversion applications. Along with blockchain technology, those voices are aimed to be the voices of the Web3.0 and the MetaVerse in the very near future. 

Besides, I love hitting the gym, playing soccer, listening to podcasts, chilling with friends near Han river. I am also into reading books in various topics: productivity, mindset, money, .etc.

If it sounds interesting to you, feel free to drop me a message.
